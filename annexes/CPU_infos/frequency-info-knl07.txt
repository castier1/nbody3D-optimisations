analyzing CPU 1:
  driver: intel_pstate
  CPUs which run at the same hardware frequency: 1
  CPUs which need to have their frequency coordinated by software: 1
  maximum transition latency:  Cannot determine or is not supported.
  hardware limits: 1000 MHz - 1.50 GHz
  available cpufreq governors: performance powersave
  current policy: frequency should be within 1000 MHz and 1.50 GHz.
                  The governor "performance" may decide which speed to use
                  within this range.
  current CPU frequency: Unable to call hardware
  current CPU frequency: 1.46 GHz (asserted by call to kernel)
  boost state support:
    Supported: yes
    Active: yes
